# SleepMessage
A simple 1.6-1.16 plugin to alert everyone online that a player is sleeping in a bed, similar to Minecraft for the Xbox 360 and how it sent a message to chat for the same reason.
In fact, this plugin tries to be the best Java Minecraft replication of what Console Edition had.

**Note:** This is _not_ a single player sleep plugin to skip to day if a player sleeps in a bed and there are others online. I may make a plugin like that in the future, but this one is _not_ that plugin. ;)
