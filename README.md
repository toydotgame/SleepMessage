# SleepMessage
A simple pre-1.8 plugin to alert everyone online that a player is sleeping in a bed, similar to Minecraft for the Xbox 360 and how it sent a message to chat for the same reason.
In fact, this plugin tries to be the best Java Minecraft replication of what Console Edition had.

**Note:** This is _not_ a single player sleep plugin to skip to day if a player sleeps in a bed and there are others online. I have made one, however; see [toydotgame](https://github.com/toydotgame)/[SinglePlayerSleep](https://github.com/toydotgame/SinglePlayerSleep).
**Note #2:** This plugin will be for Minecraft 1.8 and prior [temporarily]. Until I resume from my break from development and fix the bug with retreieving `Player` variable to send messages to (It's a feature that was deprecated in 1.8, thus causing crashes in versions past it), I'd recommend using this plugin only with older versions of Spigot.
